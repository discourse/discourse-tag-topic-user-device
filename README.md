# discourse-tag-topic-user-device

This is a Discourse plugin that automatically tags topics with a user's main operating system.

## Installation

Follow [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
how-to from the official Discourse Meta, using `git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-tag-topic-user-device.git`
as the plugin command.

## Usage

This plugin does not create the tags in your Discourse instance. To use it, add a "mac" and/or "windows" tag to your Discourse site, and then enable the plugin. New topics by non-staff users will get the mac/windows tag if the user has logged in to the site with a Mac or Windows machine.

## Feedback

If you have issues or suggestions for the plugin, please bring them up on
[Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org).
